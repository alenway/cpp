## üìà Project Progression Path

1. **Start with Mini Projects** - Build confidence with smaller, focused projects
2. **Move to Challenge Projects** - Combine multiple concepts into more complex applications
3. **Attempt Capstone Projects** - Create comprehensive systems that showcase your C mastery

## üíº Resume-Worthy Projects from This Roadmap

- **Student Record System** - CRUD operations, file I/O, structures
- **Expression Evaluator** - Stacks, parsing, algorithm implementation
- **Chat Application** - Sockets, threading, protocol design
- **Custom Memory Allocator** - Low-level system programming
- **Mini Shell** - Process control, system calls, text parsing

*You can mark topics as complete by replacing `[ ]` with `[x]` as you progress through your C programming journey.*
